I am a machine learning researcher specializing in deep learning, data compression, computer vision, and generative modeling. Currently, I work as a Senior Engineer at Qualcomm Inc. on the Multimedia Research and Development (MMRND) team in San Diego, California, where I focus on advancing cutting-edge multimedia technologies. \n\n
I earned my Ph.D. in Computer and Electrical Engineering from the University of Missouri–Kansas City, conducting research under [http://l.web.umkc.edu/lizhu/ Dr. Zhu Li] in the Multimedia Computing & Communication Lab. My doctoral work centered on innovative approaches to multimedia systems and machine learning.\n\n
Before that, I completed my M.S. in Electrical Engineering at [http://www.ku.edu.tr/ Koç University], Istanbul, Turkey,
 where I worked with [https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/scoleri/ Dr. Sinem Coleri Ergen] in the [http://wnl.ku.edu.tr/ Wireless Networks Laboratory] on 60 GHz directional wireless Communication.\n\n
My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from [http://www.lums.edu.pk/ Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)] in Lahore, Pakistan, laying the foundation for my passion for advanced communication systems and AI-driven technologies.

*Point Cloud Denoising.*\n\n
Point clouds obtained from 3D scanners or by image-based reconstruction techniques are often corrupted with a significant amount of non-negligible noise.
- We propose a two-stage deep neural network that takes in 3D point cloud data and outputs a denoised point cloud.
- 1st stage: Outlier removal.
- 2nd stage: Denoising surface noise.
- We achieve state-of-the-art point cloud denoising results.
